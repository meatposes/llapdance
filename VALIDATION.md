# Validation run — 2026-08-01

First real end-to-end test of LLAPDANCE against actual hardware: build/start a
llama.cpp container on a real Intel Arc GPU, run the benchmark + coherence
adapters against it, store the result, confirm teardown, confirm config-only
modularity. Suite used: `examples/validation.suite.yaml`.

## Result: it works

```
=== bonsai-validation (12cea5493a10) ===
  [generic-http] {'avg_ttft_ms': 201.8, 'avg_total_ms': 1034.1, 'avg_tokens_per_sec': 36.5, 'requests': 3.0}
  [fixed-questions] 10/10 passed
```

- Container built (resolved from local cache since `mode: prebuilt`), started with real GPU access, health-polled, benchmarked, coherence-checked, torn down — cleanly, no leftover container (`docker ps -a` confirmed clean after every run).
- Ran it twice; the second run's `RunOutcome.delta_against` correctly pointed at the first run's `RunResult` — the flat-file storage adapter's delta lookup works, not just theoretical.
- Re-ran with `--set benchmark_adapters.0.config.num_requests=1 --set benchmark_adapters.0.config.prompt="Say hello."` and no file edits — result changed (`requests: 1.0`, faster total time) confirming config, not code, drives behavior. This also surfaced and fixed a real bug (see below).
- The already-running production `llama-cpp-bonsai` container was never touched — confirmed via its own healthcheck before/after.

## Bug found in our own code: `--set` couldn't index into lists

`_deep_merge` treated `--set benchmark_adapters.0.config.x=y` as `{"benchmark_adapters": {"0": {...}}}` and merged that dict directly onto the real list, which Pydantic then rejected (`Input should be a valid list`). Fixed in `llapdance/config/loader.py::_deep_merge`: when the override at a given key is a dict with all-digit keys and the base value is a list, it's now treated as index assignment. Covered by `tests/test_config.py::test_deep_merge_indexes_into_lists`.

**Breadcrumb:** this only surfaced by actually running the CLI against a real suite with a list-valued override — the existing unit tests only exercised dict/dict merging. Worth remembering when adding new config fields: exercise the actual CLI path, not just the Pydantic model, before calling an adapter "done."

## Bug found in the test suite itself, mid-build

Adding the new startup-readiness poll (`_wait_until_ready`, see below) broke the existing orchestrator unit tests — they hung for up to 120s because the fake test backend's endpoint (`http://fake:8000`) isn't a real host and the poll kept retrying until `startup_timeout_s`. Fixed by monkeypatching `_wait_until_ready` to a no-op in orchestrator unit tests (`tests/test_orchestrator.py`), and added a dedicated `tests/test_startup_wait.py` that mocks `httpx.get` directly to test the polling/timeout logic in isolation. **Breadcrumb:** any new blocking-network-call added to orchestrator core needs either a fake-friendly seam or its own isolated test — don't let it hide inside a test that's supposed to be about something else.

## Bug found in the target under test: llama.cpp tokenizer crash

Not a harness bug — a real, reproducible bug in the environment being tested, caught precisely because we tried to run a coherence-style request against it:

- `llama-cpp-bonsai:meat6-hardened` + `Ternary-Bonsai-27B-dspark-Q4_1.gguf` loads fine, answers `/health` fine, then **SIGSEGVs** (`GGML_ASSERT(tokenizer && "Tokenizer not initialized...")`) on the very first `/v1/chat/completions` request.
- The same image with `Ternary-Bonsai-27B-Q2_0.gguf` (the variant already running in production) answers correctly (`12 + 30 = **42**`).
- This is exactly the "loads and looks fine, then falls over or produces garbage on real use" failure class the coherence check exists to catch (SPEC.md §11) — except this one crashes outright rather than producing garbled output, which the benchmark/health-check alone would have completely missed (health was `{"status":"ok"}` right up until the crash).
- Not yet root-caused (custom `-dspark` quant variant vs. tokenizer init path in this particular build) — flagging for whoever owns that image/quant next.

## What this proves about "modular enough to be configurable"

- Swapped nothing in code to point at a different model/image/GPU/port/benchmark-prompt — all suite YAML + one CLI `--set` override.
- The execution adapter, benchmark adapter, and coherence adapter never referenced each other directly; the orchestrator was the only thing that knew about all three, exactly per SPEC.md §5's intent.
- Registering a second `local-docker`-shaped SSH-based execution adapter, or a second benchmark adapter, requires only implementing the ABC in `llapdance/plugins/base.py` and calling `register()` — proven by how easily the test suite's `FakeExecutionTarget`/`FakeBenchmark`/`FakeCoherence` slotted in without touching orchestrator code.

## Gaps found that required real code changes (not just config)

These were missing entirely before this validation pass — the spec anticipated the categories but the v0.1 build hadn't implemented the mechanics yet:

1. **`BackendConfig.command`** (raw CLI args) — llama.cpp's SYCL server takes model path, GPU device, and context size as CLI flags (`-m`, `-dev`, `-c`...), not environment variables. The harness had no way to pass a container command at all before this. Added as a raw list-of-strings passthrough; there is still no translation from `params.shared` (the normalized cross-backend knobs from SPEC.md §4) into a concrete command — that per-engine "wrapper" (SPEC.md's original vision: "each engine wrapper knows what params it accepts and translates them") is the next real piece of work, not yet built. Breadcrumb for whoever builds the first real per-engine adapter: this is where that translation logic goes, likely one small module per engine family (`llama_cpp_sycl.py`, `vllm_xpu.py`, etc.) that takes `BackendParams` and emits the `command`/`env` a raw `BackendConfig` needs today.
2. **`BackendConfig.volumes`** — mounting the actual model file into the container. Read-only bind mounts only; no rw/tmpfs case has come up yet.
3. **`BackendConfig.devices`** — **this was the actual blocker**, not GPU selection env vars. Without `--device /dev/dri:/dev/dri` passed through, the container has zero GPU visibility and SYCL throws `No device of requested type available` — a *different* error than a bad device index would produce, and easy to misdiagnose as a device-selector problem instead of a missing-passthrough problem. Breadcrumb: **check device passthrough before debugging device *selection*** — the symptom (no device found) looks identical either way, but the fix is completely different (`--device` flag vs. an env var).
4. **`_wait_until_ready` / startup health-poll** — the orchestrator previously assumed a container was immediately ready to serve traffic the instant `docker run` returned. Real model loading takes real time (several seconds even for a small quant); every real benchmark/coherence request would have hit connection-refused without this. Added a polling wait against `backend.health_path` with `startup_timeout_s`. Breadcrumb: any future execution-target adapter (e.g. the not-yet-built SSH one) needs the same contract — `RunningBackend.endpoint` must be a URL the orchestrator can poll, readiness is not the execution adapter's job to guarantee before returning.

## GPU targeting: what's confirmed, what's still open

- `clinfo -l` (OpenCL) enumeration order and llama.cpp's SYCL/level-zero device order are **separate index spaces that are not guaranteed to correspond** — `core/probe.py`'s `discover_devices()` reports OpenCL-order indices (used for VRAM preflight / device-target recording), while the actual pinning that worked used `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:N` supplied directly in `BackendConfig.env`, a completely separate enumeration. This is exactly SPEC.md §7's flagged open decision, now confirmed as a real problem rather than a theoretical one — the two numbering schemes must eventually be reconciled (or explicitly documented as unreconciled) before "GPU2" can mean one consistent thing across the probe layer and the actual pinning mechanism.
- Concretely confirmed today: `level_zero:0` = an Intel Arc Pro B70 with only ~3.7GB free at the time (something else was already using it) — still enough headroom for this small quant to load. `level_zero:1` is whatever the already-running production `llama-cpp-bonsai` container is pinned to (untouched, not re-verified today).
- Intel free-VRAM detection is still unimplemented (`probe.py::free_vram_mb` returns `None` for Intel, fail-closed per SPEC.md §7) — today's run only proceeded because `allow_unknown_vram: true` was set after manually eyeballing the numbers above, exactly the escape hatch the spec described and exactly why it defaults to `false`.

## Updated adapter status (see README.md, now reflects reality instead of aspiration)

| Adapter | Status |
|---|---|
| `local-docker` execution | Real, validated against actual GPU hardware today. |
| `generic-http` benchmark | Real, validated — got real TTFT/throughput numbers from a real llama.cpp server. |
| `fixed-questions` coherence | Real, validated — 10/10 against a working model; also indirectly caught the tokenizer crash bug during earlier iteration of this same suite. |
| `flat-file` storage | Real, validated — write + delta-lookup both exercised. |
| `llama-benchy` benchmark | Still a stub — unrelated to today's validation, no new information. |
| SSH execution target | Not built. Today's `RunningBackend`/`ExecutionTargetAdapter` contract was exercised only locally; nothing here contradicts the contract working remotely, but it's unverified. |
| OpenSearch / embedded-DB / Prometheus storage | Not built. |
